The PICnc driver requires some setup based on your firmware options.

In /HAL/picnc-5a.h edit the following line:
"#define NUMAXES"

and make sure it matches the value of "#define MAXGEN" in /firmware/hardware.h

If these missmatch bad things will happen and you may get SPI errors. 

To compile the code and install it in machinekit linuxcnc use the following:
sudo comp --install picnc-5a.c


[TODO add example ini and hal files]
