PICnc-5axis
========

PICnc 5 axis is a PIC32 based hardware step generator board that is designed for MachineKit based off kinsamanka's PICnc-V2 project. 

Expanded channels + GPIOs due to the use of a 44 pin package PIC32. 
No intergrated drivers. Outputs step + dir for external high power driver modules. 
All IOs on screw terminal blocks.
Also added support for laser cutters with isolated laser_on and laser_PWM outputs and related hardware inhibits.
